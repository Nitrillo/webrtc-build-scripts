webrtc-build-scripts
====================

Build scripts derived from various README files of the [WebRTC project] [1], as
well as some experience using the library.

Note that cross-compilng is not an objective. These scripts are meant to be run
on the hosts that they are building for. The Android build environment is 
assumed to be Ubuntu, and details for setting this up is available from 
multiple projects, including [Android] [2], [WebRTC] [3], and [Chromium] [4].
iOS & OS X builds assume a typical OS X development setup.
